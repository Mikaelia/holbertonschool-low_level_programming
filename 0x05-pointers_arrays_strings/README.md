# 0x05. C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings
  
#### A project on:
- Pointers, arrays, and the differences between them
- String manipulation
- Variable scope

## Requirements
- Use of the standard library not permitted. Use of functions such as printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Use of function _putchar is permitted
- Main files added at compilation
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar will be included in the header file `holberton.h`

## Challenges

**[0-strcat.c](0-strcat.c)** - A function that concatenates two strings
	- It returns a pointer `dest`

**[1-strncat.c](1-strncat.c)** - A function that concatenates two strings
	- It will use at most n bytes from `src`
	- It returns a pointer `dest`

**[2-strncpy.c](2-strncpy.c)** - A function that copies a string

**[3-strcmp.c](3-strcmp.c)** - a function that compares two strings

**[4-rev_array.c](4-rev_array.c)** - A function that reverses the content of an array of integers

**[5-string_toupper.c](5-string_toupper.c)** - A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

**[6-cap_string.c](6-cap_string.c)** - A function that capitalizes all words of a string

**[7-leet.c](7-leet.c)** - A function that encodes a string into 1337

**[8-rot13.c](8-rot13.c)** - A function that encodes a string using rot13
