# 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
  
#### A project on:
- Nested loops
- Functions and prototypes
- The use of header files

## Requirements
- Use of the standard library not permitted. Use of functions such as printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Use of function _putchar is permitted
- Main files added at compilation
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar will be included in the header file `holberton.h`

## Challenges

**[0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c)** - A function that checks for an uppercase character.

**[1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c)** - A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

**[2-mul.c](2-mul.c)** - A function that multiplies two integers

**[3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c)** - A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

**[4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c)** - A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
	- Does not print 2 or 4

**[5-more_numbers.c](5-more_numbers.c)** - A function that prints 10 times the numbers 0 to 14, followed by a new line

**[6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c)** - A function that draws a straight line in the termina

**[7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c)** - A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal

**[8-print_square.c](8-print_square.c)** - A function that prints a square, followed by a new line

**[9-fizz_buzz.c](9-fizz_buzz.c)** - A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three prints Fizz and for multiples of five prints Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five prints FizzBuzz.

**[10-print_triangle.c](10-print_triangle.c)** - A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line

## Advanced

**[100-prime_factor.c](100-prime_factor.c)** - a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line
