# 0x00-hello_world
  
A project on:
#### How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
#### How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
#### How to compile using gcc
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vim, emacs
- All scripts tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
## Challenges
**[0-preprocessor](0-preprocessor)** - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
	* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`

**[1-compiler](1-compiler)** - A script that compiles a C file but does not link
	*The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`

**[2-assembler](2-assembler)** - A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
 	*The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`

**[3-name](3-name)** - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`
	* Use of `printf` not permitted
	* The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

**[4-puts.c](4-puts.c)** - A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line
	* Use of`printf` not permitted

**[5-printf.c](5-printf.c)** - A C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,` followed by a new line
	* Use of `puts` not permitted

**[6-size.c](6-size.c)** - A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
