# 0x00-hello_world
  
An introductory project on:
#### How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
#### How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
#### How to compile using gcc
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vim, emacs
- All scripts tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
## File Descriptions
### Mandatory

	* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`

* **[1-compiler](1-compiler)** - Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
	*The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`

* **[2-assembler](2-assembler)** - Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
 	*The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.

* **[3-name](3-name)** - Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
	* You are not allowed to use `printf`.
	* The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

* **[4-puts.c](4-puts.c)** - Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
	* You are not allowed to use `printf`

* **[5-printf.c](5-printf.c)** - Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
