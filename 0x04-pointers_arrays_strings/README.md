# 0x04. C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings
  
#### A project on:
- Pointers, arrays, and the differences between them
- String manipulation
- Variable scope

## Requirements
- Use of the standard library not permitted. Use of functions such as printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Use of function _putchar is permitted
- Main files added at compilation
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar will be included in the header file `holberton.h`

## Challenges

**[0-reset_to_98.c](0-reset_to_98.c)** - A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98

**[1-swap.c](1-swap.c)** - A function that swaps the values of two integers

**[2-strlen.c](2-strlen.c)** - A function that returns the length of a string

**[3-puts.c](3-puts.c)** - A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout

**[4-print_rev.c](4-print_rev.c)** - A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line

**[5-rev_string.c](5-rev_string.c)** - A function that reverses a string

**[6-puts2.c](6-puts2.c)** - A function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line.

**[7-puts_half.c](7-puts_half.c)** - A function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line

**[8-print_array.c](8-print_array.c)** - A function that  that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line

**[9-strcpy.c](9-strcpy.c)** - copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`
