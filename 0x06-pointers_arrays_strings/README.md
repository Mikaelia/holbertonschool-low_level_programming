# 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
  
#### A project on:
- Pointers and arrays
- String manipulation
- Variable scope

## Requirements
- Use of the standard library not permitted. Use of functions such as printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Use of function _putchar is permitted
- Main files added at compilation
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar will be included in the header file `holberton.h`

## Challenges

**[0-memset.c](0-memset.c)** - A function that fills memory with a constant byte

**[1-memcpy.c](1-memcpy.cc)** - A function that copies memory area

**[2-strchr.c](2-strchr.c)** - A function that locates a character in a string

**[3-strspn.c](3-strspn.c)** - A function that gets the length of a prefix substring

**[4-strpbrk.c](4-strpbrk.c)** - A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes

**[5-strstr.c](5-strstr.c)** - A function that locates a substring

**[7-print_chessboard.c](7-print_chessboard.c)** - A function that prints the chessboard

**[8-print_diagsums.c](8-print_diagsums.c)** - A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers

**[9-set_string.c](9-set_string.c)** - A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
