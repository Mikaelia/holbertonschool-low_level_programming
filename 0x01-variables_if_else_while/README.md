## Challenges

 **[0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c)** - Completes the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative

 **[1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c)** - Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n

 **[2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c)** - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line

 **[3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c)** - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line

 - Only the `putchar` function permitted

**[4-print_alphabt.c](4-print_alphabt.c)** - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line

- Prints all the letters except q and e
- Only _putchar function permitted

**[5-print_numbers.c](5-print_numbers.c)** - A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line

**[6-print_numberz.c](6-print_numberz.c)** - A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line

- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
- Only the `putchar` function permitted (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)

**[7-print_tebahpla.c](7-print_tebahpla.c)** - A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line

**[8-print_base16.c](8-print_base16.c)** - A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line

**[9-print_comb.c](9-print_comb.c)** - A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers

**[10-print_comb2.c](10-print_comb2.c)** - A program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99

### Advanced
**[100-print_comb3.c](100-print_comb3.c)** - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- The two digits must be different
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- You can only use the `putchar` function
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
